A soapy scrubber sponge is usually sufficient but if your mess is particularly stubborn, pour ¼ cup of water in the pan and heat it over medium heat, stirring up the burnt bits with a wooden spoon. Pour off the hot water then use a wet sponge and very thick paste of water and Americraft Stainless Steel Cleaner, baking soda or your favorite stainless steel cleanser.\n\n\tStainless-Steel Pan is NON-STICK | The Water Test | The Prince Eats"}},"question_answer_JKGFyc":{"type":"question_answer","settings":{"question":"<p>What Is On My Pan? <\/p>","answer":"White Spots- These are salt deposits that can form when using salt in cooking or salt water, they can be removed with a paste of vinegar and stainless steel cleaner. \n\tRainbow Discoloration- This is most often caused by overheating the cookware or bakeware.

To fry, simply preheat your empty skillet on medium-low. Since eggs don’t release moisture or fat, after preheating you will add a small amount of butter, oil or cooking spray and fry as usual.\n\nTo boil an egg without water, place a wet paper towel in the bottom of a small pan. Insert 3 eggs (for starters) and place the lid on the unit. Cook on medium heat until a vapor seal is formed and the lid spins, then turn to low. With the cover on, cook for 13 - 15 minutes for hard eggs, 7 - 8 minutes for medium, and 5 minutes for soft. Remove the paper towel and pour cold water over eggs. Replace the cover and shake to crack the shells. Peel and serve. A special bonus – no greenish ring around the yoke!"}},"question_answer_wjQXeq":{"type":"question_answer","settings":{"question":"<p>What About Cooking Meats?<\/p>","answer":"Burgers, steaks, or pork chops come out moist and tasty using the same easy procedure as chicken.\n\nFor seafood recipes, use the same technique with a little less heat. If desired, add a little butter or extra virgin olive oil to taste. Fish dishes will cook up moist, flaky and tender every time.\n\nFor beef or pork roasts and wild game, preheat the pan on medium heat. Sear and brown on one side for 10 minutes with the cover off. Then add thickly sliced onions and\/or other vegetables beneath the roast, cover with a lid and cook on low for 40-50 minutes.\n\nAny meat entrée recipe will turn out moist and delicious in a fraction of the cooking time of conventional cookware – all without added oil, lard, or shortening!"}},"question_answer_NcAwNM":{"type":"question_answer","settings":{"question":"<p>Can I Use Vapor® Cooking Technology To Cook Rice, Pasta, Vegetables, And Beans?<\/p>","answer":"360 Cookware makes cooking these foods easier than ever!\n\nFor rice, pour 1 3\/4 cups of water and 1 cup of rice into a utensil - no need to bring water to a boil first. Place the utensil on medium heat and cover. When you see vapor escaping from the lid, turn to low and cook for 8 minutes, then remove from heat. Let utensils stand covered for 25-30 minutes. The rice will not overcook, and will turn out tender and fluffy every time! Tip: Add raisins and serve with milk and honey for a delicious and healthy breakfast.\n\nCook beans and pasta just like you always have, but in 30% less time using only medium to low heat! Because beans and pasta have no moisture, you will need to add water. But don’t worry about soaking those beans all night – 360 Cookware makes soaking a thing of the past! Now you can enjoy beans whenever you want them, without having to plan ahead.\n\nFor vegetables, fill your 360 Vapor® Cookware at least two-thirds full with cut veggies, cover and cook on medium heat until you see vapor escaping, then reduce the heat to low. Cook for about 5-8 minutes and remove from heat. Allow to sit 10 minutes with the cover on and serve. Broccoli, carrots, brussel sprouts, turnips, fresh spinach, green beans and other veggies turn out fresh, crisp and delicious. Since kids often complain about veggies’ soggy texture, try serving them the crisp, colorful version instead!"}},"question_answer_GYUDM9":{"type":"question_answer","settings":{"question":"<p>Can I Cook My Food With Butter Or Oil?<\/p>","answer":"Yes. With Vapor® Cooking, you won’t need it (except for stovetop baking, frying eggs, or searing fish), but if you want it you’ll find you need much less than you normally use. Begin with half the amount of oil or butter you usually cook with, or, try drizzling a robust extra virgin olive oil and a little fresh lemon juice over some just-cooked fish or chicken to “finish” your dish."}},"question_answer_M7T6Cg":{"type":"question_answer","settings":{"question":"<p>How Do I Make Pancakes, French Toast, Grilled Cheese Or Any Other Breaded Food?<\/p>","answer":"Preheat your unit on medium heat for one to two minutes.  Dance a bead of water on it. When it evaporates add oil or butter.  Fry as usual."}}},"block_order":["title_VQ6TR6","question_answer_PLPwaq","question_answer_QcFFX6","question_answer_yXby4G","question_answer_dLmVmk","question_answer_jzhiPJ","question_answer_UnJBza","question_answer_kHwM9w","question_answer_CyYUcL","question_answer_iYXyB4","question_answer_8baVnJ","title_N6CD4B","question_answer_Wp7GDQ","question_answer_LBRNUM","question_answer_9gybYE","question_answer_JKGFyc","question_answer_VHzTbf","title_edDFYU","question_answer_TLahpR","question_answer_84r6B9","title_aY8XmQ","question_answer_j7Jjm8","question_answer_gJMb4w","question_answer_wjQXeq","question_answer_NcAwNM","question_answer_GYUDM9","question_answer_M7T6Cg"],"settings":{"faq_title":"FAQ","search_placeholder":"Search by question","title1":"FAQs","text1":"<p>Use this section for any descriptive text you need to fill out your pages or to add introductory headings between other blocks.<\/p>"}},"contect_form_qUkTjH":{"type":"contect-form","settings":{"contact_title":"Contact us","contact_email":"Customer_Inquiries@360Cookware.com","contact_hours":"Monday- Friday from 8am-5pm est.","need_help_title":"Need Help?","need_help_text":"Have more questions or need personalized advice?
