In a barn near the heartland community of West Bend, Wisconsin, USA, two American farmers, brothers skilled in the art of metal work, hand-crafted the world’s first known waterless cookware. They designed a water seal rim around the edge of the utensil, which would eventually change the way the health conscious cooks of America prepare meals for their families. The two-brother team engineered fasteners on the cover that would seal in the natural flavors and nutrients of the fresh, organic vegetables they grew on their farms.<br/><br/></p>",

Truth be told, although the pair didn’t know it yet, their invention was also the first handmade “eco-friendly” cookware in America. They named their product Kitchen Craft. Shortly after its invention, production of this new innovation in food preparation began. With the lack of retail stores in rural America, the brothers chose to sell the miracle device through in-home demonstrations. Kitchen Craft’s success was so overwhelming they were joined by a team of investors, rented a button factory situated on the west bend of the Milwaukee River, and started America’s first waterless cookware manufacturing facility. They gave it a simple monicker— the West Bend Aluminum Company.</p>",
