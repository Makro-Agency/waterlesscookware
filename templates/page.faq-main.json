A soapy scrubber sponge is usually sufficient but if your mess is particularly stubborn, pour ¼ cup of water in the pan and heat it over medium heat, stirring up the burnt bits with a wooden spoon. Pour off the hot water then use a wet sponge and very thick paste of water and Americraft Stainless Steel Cleaner, baking soda or your favorite stainless steel cleanser."

To avoid this, reduce the cooking temperature.<br>\t\nCloudy Discoloration- This is caused by hard water used during cooking. It can be removed with baking soda and a scrubber or some stainless steel cleaner. To avoid this, in the future a water softening system will help."

            "answer": "A stuck lid is caused by a vacuum inside the pot. The best way to solve this issue is to let the pot cool down. Another option is to place a hot towel on the lid for a few minutes to get the lid unstuck. If becoming room temperature or a hot towel does not allow the lid to be removed try putting the pot in the fridge or freezer to further loosen the vacuum suction."

            "answer": "Absolutely. To fry, simply preheat your empty skillet on medium-low. Since eggs don’t release moisture or fat, after preheating you will add a small amount of butter, oil or cooking spray and fry as usual.\n<br>\nTo boil an egg without water, place a wet paper towel in the bottom of a small pan. Insert 3 eggs (for starters) and place the lid on the unit. Cook on medium heat until a vapor seal is formed and the lid spins, then turn to low. With the cover on, cook for 13 - 15 minutes for hard eggs, 7 - 8 minutes for medium, and 5 minutes for soft. Remove the paper towel and pour cold water over eggs. Replace the cover and shake to crack the shells. Peel and serve. A special bonus – no greenish ring around the yoke!"

            "answer": "Burgers, steaks, or pork chops come out moist and tasty using the same easy procedure as chicken.\nFor seafood recipes, use the same technique with a little less heat. If desired, add a little butter or extra virgin olive oil to taste. Fish dishes will cook up moist, flaky and tender every time.\n<br>\nFor beef or pork roasts and wild game, preheat the pan on medium heat. Sear and brown on one side for 10 minutes with the cover off. Then add thickly sliced onions and/or other vegetables beneath the roast, cover with a lid and cook on low for 40-50 minutes.\n<br>\nAny meat entrée recipe will turn out moist and delicious in a fraction of the cooking time of conventional cookware – all without added oil, lard, or shortening!"

            "question": "<p>Can I Use Vapor® Cooking Technology To Cook Rice, Pasta, Vegetables, And Beans?</p>",
            "answer": "Kitchen Craft Cookware makes cooking these foods easier than ever!\n<br>\nFor rice, pour 1 3/4 cups of water and 1 cup of rice into a utensil - no need to bring water to a boil first. Place the utensil on medium heat and cover. When you see vapor escaping from the lid, turn to low and cook for 8 minutes, then remove from heat. Let utensils stand covered for 25-30 minutes. The rice will not overcook, and will turn out tender and fluffy every time! Tip: Add raisins and serve with milk and honey for a delicious and healthy breakfast."

            "answer": "Yes. With Vapor® Cooking, you won’t need it (except for stovetop baking, frying eggs, or searing fish), but if you want it you’ll find you need much less than you normally use. Begin with half the amount of oil or butter you usually cook with, or, try drizzling a robust extra virgin olive oil and a little fresh lemon juice over some just-cooked fish or chicken to “finish” your dish."
