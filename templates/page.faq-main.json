            "answer": "Thanks to the highest-quality, American-made, T316 surgical stainless steel we use to line all our cookware, Kitchen Craft Cookware is amazingly easy to clean — no matter how burnt-on foods appear to be. A soapy scrubber sponge is usually sufficient but if your mess is particularly stubborn, pour ¼ cup of water in the pan and heat it over medium heat, stirring up the burnt bits with a wooden spoon. Pour off the hot water then use a wet sponge and very thick paste of water and Americraft Stainless Steel Cleaner, baking soda or your favorite stainless steel cleanser."

It can be removed by either using some baking soda and a scrubber or stainless steel cleaner. To avoid this, reduce the cooking temperature.<br>\t\nCloudy Discoloration- This is caused by hard water used during cooking. It can be removed with baking soda and a scrubber or some stainless steel cleaner. To avoid this, in the future a water softening system will help."

            "answer": "A stuck lid is caused by a vacuum inside the pot. The best way to solve this issue is to let the pot cool down. Another option is to place a hot towel on the lid for a few minutes to get the lid unstuck. If becoming room temperature or a hot towel does not allow the lid to be removed try putting the pot in the fridge or freezer to further loosen the vacuum suction."

            "answer": "Absolutely. To fry, simply preheat your empty skillet on medium-low. Since eggs don’t release moisture or fat, after preheating you will add a small amount of butter, oil or cooking spray and fry as usual.\n<br>\nTo boil an egg without water, place a wet paper towel in the bottom of a small pan. Insert 3 eggs (for starters) and place the lid on the unit. Cook on medium heat until a vapor seal is formed and the lid spins, then turn to low. With the cover on, cook for 13 - 15 minutes for hard eggs, 7 - 8 minutes for medium, and 5 minutes for soft. Remove the paper towel and pour cold water over eggs. Replace the cover and shake to crack the shells. Peel and serve. A special bonus – no greenish ring around the yoke!"
