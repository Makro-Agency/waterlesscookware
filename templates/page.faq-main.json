A soapy scrubber sponge is usually sufficient but if your mess is particularly stubborn, pour ¼ cup of water in the pan and heat it over medium heat, stirring up the burnt bits with a wooden spoon. Pour off the hot water then use a wet sponge and very thick paste of water and Americraft Stainless Steel Cleaner, baking soda or your favorite stainless steel cleanser."

It can be removed by either using some baking soda and a scrubber or stainless steel cleaner. To avoid this, reduce the cooking temperature.<br>\t\nCloudy Discoloration- This is caused by hard water used during cooking. It can be removed with baking soda and a scrubber or some stainless steel cleaner. To avoid this, in the future a water softening system will help."
